A shitty physics engine for the browser built from scratch in pure Javascript.

I love how game engine works, and it's even more fascinating how games can be created to run in the browsers.
Browsers are more powerful now than ever!

This shitty engine implemets simple physics principles like gravity, velocity, accleration etc.
Can be used to create simple real life simulations, objects to be run in the browser.
